Hi! Iâ€™m William, a cybersecurity analyst with a degree in Information Science from San Jose State University.
I have long focused on the role of security in information science and technology, but I also care about issues like governance, privacy, and accountability in the ever-changing world of AI technologies.

I have various interests in information security, computer forensics, data analytics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.
As a recent graduate entering the workforce, my goal is to contribute positively to these fields, continuously learn, and develop my skills. I am passionate about being someone who can offer guidance and support in these areas.

## My Background & History
I am a cybersecurity analyst with a broad background in data analytics.
I consider myself to have an introductory understanding of these fields in practical settings outside of the classroom. 
However, I possess enough educational knowledge to quickly adapt to new concepts and environments.
Currently, I'm pivoting towards AI and data analytics within the cloud and have begun studying issues such as security, transparency, and regulation.

The previous jobs I've taken were ones I believed would benefit the community, while also providing valuable experience as a bonus.



## My Creative Side
My interests include computer building, game development, and cloud computing. 
I spend a lot of my time in technology, whether it's setting up servers, assembling PCs, or keeping up with the latest tools. 
There's always more to learn, and my hobbies keep me busy.
